> > The surface segregation energy is the energy cost of transferring an impurity atom from the interior to the surface of a host crystal and may therefore be defined as the difference in the total energies of the system with the impurity in a surface layer and in the bulk.

> Segregation Energy: $E^{surf}_{inpurity }-E^{bulk}_{inpurity }$

> > In fact, even if the segregation energy of a single impurity is negative, there may be segregation reversal in a concentrated alloy, as it happens, for instance, at the ~110! surface of PtNi.3

> 什么叫 concentrated alloy?
> 噢我好像明白意思了。是说 single inpurity 的 Segregation Energy 和 multiple inpurity 的 Segregation Energy 完全可能是不同符号的。这倒是个值得注意的点。

> > Further, due to the large difference in the reactivity of transition metals with gases such as CO, O 2 , and N 2 the surface composition of a transition-metal alloy is very sensitive to the external conditions of an experiment; see for instance Ref. 62.
