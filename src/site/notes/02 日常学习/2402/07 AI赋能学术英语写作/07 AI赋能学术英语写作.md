Recent research has shown that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in a wide range of human physiological processes, including digestion and immune function. Disruptions in these microbial communities, known as dysbiosis, can lead to various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.

AI: The importance of the gut microbiome in maintaining human health is highlighted by its impact on multiple physiological processes, such as digestion and immune system function. Research has shown that when the balance of microbial communities in the gut is disrupted, a condition known as dysbiosis, it can contribute to the development of various diseases, including obesity and inflammatory bowel disease.
# 9、teamwork论文-introduction
The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has had a profound impact on the medical domain, spawning novel strategies for treating a plethora of severe diseases. Among these, the development of intelligent drug delivery nanoplatforms stands out, as it aims to optimize treatment outcomes while mitigating adverse side effects. Currently, a wide array of materials is being investigated for drug delivery applications. Organic materials, such as micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, and polymers, are noted for their favorable biocompatibility and low toxicity. However, their restricted porosity often impedes the controlled release of drugs. In contrast, inorganic materials like mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles, and quantum dots present advantages in terms of shape and size controllability and surface modification, facilitating more precise drug delivery. Nevertheless, their biocompatibility and drug-loading capacity still require further enhancement.
 Metal - Organic Frameworks (MOFs) represent a class of highly porous crystalline materials, combining the merits of organic and inorganic materials. These are formed by coordinating inorganic metal (encompassing transition metals and lanthanide metals) ions or clusters as nodes with organic ligands (such as carboxylates, phosphonates, imidazolates, and phenolates) as pillars, thereby constructing one-, two-, or three-dimensional networks. Since their inception in 1989, MOFs have garnered extensive attention and have been extensively studied in diverse fields, including gas storage, catalysis, sensing, and semiconductors, owing to their high surface area-to-volume ratio and porosity. In the context of drug delivery systems, MOFs, as a modifiable biodegradable materials with combined advantages, is now attracting considerable attention.
 This paper centers on the research progress of MOFs in drug delivery systems, exploring multiple facets such. Concurrently, the challenges associated will be deliberated , with the overarching aim of furnishing a valuable reference for the further application of MOFs as advanced drug delivery systems.
