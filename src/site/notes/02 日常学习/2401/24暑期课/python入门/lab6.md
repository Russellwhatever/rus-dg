# 1.basic
We just need to call the load_img function and save_img function in the module FudanImageLib.py. What we input is the input_file path and the output_file path,and in the code,it will print the height and length of the image then save it.
The following is the screenshot of the result,and it will produce a new file named 2.png.

![99 Attachment/img.png](/img/user/99%20Attachment/img.png)
# 2. red_filter
We defined a function named red_filter(pic) and successfully filter the picture with it. Below is our termination workflow and pictures before and after the invertion. Pictures used can be found in the same directory named as OhtoAi.png and filtered_OhtoAi.png respectively.
