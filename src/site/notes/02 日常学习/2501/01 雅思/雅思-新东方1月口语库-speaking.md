> > Describe an old friend you had lost touch with and got in contact with again 又联系上的旧时老友 
> 
>I’d like to talk about an old friend of mine, Zhang Kewai. We first became acquainted when we were roommates in high school. We had a lot in common, particularly our shared enthusiasm for online novels and animated series. We would often spend hours discussing plot twists, character development, and our favorite fictional worlds. Our friendship was built on these mutual interests, and we were inseparable during those years.
However, after high school, we both went to different universities in separate cities. As a result, our communication became less frequent, and eventually, we lost touch altogether. The demands of university life and the challenges of adapting to new environments made it difficult to maintain old connections, and we both drifted apart over time.
Recently, while reflecting on my past, I happened to come across an old photo of us during a trip we took together. It brought back fond memories, so I decided to search for him on social media. To my delight, I found his profile and sent him a message. Surprisingly, he responded right away, and we quickly rekindled our friendship. We’ve since exchanged messages and plans to meet up soon.
I felt a great sense of joy and nostalgia when we reconnected. It was as if no time had passed at all, and our bond felt as strong as ever. I was especially glad to discover that, despite the years apart, we still had so much in common. Reconnecting with an old friend like Zhang Kewai reminded me of the importance of cherishing relationships, even when life takes us in different directions.
